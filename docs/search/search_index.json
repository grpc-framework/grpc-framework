By following these conventions, you'll make your protocol buffer message definitions and their corresponding classes consistent and easy to read. Note that protocol buffer style has evolved over time, so it is likely that you will see .proto files written in different conventions or styles. Please respect the existing style when you modify these files. Consistency is key. However, it is best to adopt the current best style when you are creating a new .proto file. The following documentation is provided as a set of guidelines to help you in your gRPC APIs. Types \u00b6 string types should be used only for ids, messages, or opaque values. They are not meant to marshal information as a yaml . Instead create a concrete message . Only use map<string, string> for opaque values like labels, key-value pairs, etc. Do not use them for operations. Use enums instead. Value options should not be passed as string . Instead of passing \"Done\", or \"paused\", use enums for these value, making it clear to the reader. Try not to use uint64 . Instead try to use signed int64 . (See CSI #172 ) Services \u00b6 See CSI as an example. Use Camelcase Services should be in the format AppName<Service Name> . Note that the service is a collection of APIs and are grouped as such in the documentation. Here is an example for OpenStorageVolume RPCs \u00b6 All APIs should have a single message for the request and a single message for the response with the following style: [App]<Service Type><Api Name>Request|Response See CSI as an example. RPCs will be created as methods to the service object , therefore there is no need to add the service name as part of the RPC. For example, use Foo , or Bar instead or ServiceFoo or ServiceBar as RPC names. Enums \u00b6 Follow the Google protobuf style for enums According to the Google guide, the enum of zero value should be labeled as UNSPECIFIED to check if it was not set since 0 is the default value set when the client does not provide it. Wrap enums in messages so that their string values are clearer. Wrapping an enum in a message also has the benefit of not needing to prefix the enums with namespaced information. For example, instead of using the enum XATTR_UNSPECIFIED , the example above uses just UNSPECIFIED since it is inide the Xattr message. The generated code will be namepaced: Proto: // Xattr defines implementation specific volume attribute message Xattr { enum Value { // Value is uninitialized or unknown UNSPECIFIED = 0; // Enable on-demand copy-on-write on the volume COW_ON_DEMAND = 1; } } Using the enum in a Proto message VolumeSpec { // Holds the extended attributes for the volume Xattr.Value xattr = 1; } Notice the namepaced and string values in the generated output code: type Xattr_Value int32 const ( // Value is uninitialized or unknown Xattr_UNSPECIFIED Xattr_Value = 0 // Enable on-demand copy-on-write on the volume Xattr_COW_ON_DEMAND Xattr_Value = 1 ) var Xattr_Value_name = map[int32]string{ 0: \"UNSPECIFIED\", 1: \"COW_ON_DEMAND\", } var Xattr_Value_value = map[string]int32{ \"UNSPECIFIED\": 0, \"COW_ON_DEMAND\": 1, } typedef VolueSpec struct { // Holds the extended attributes for the volume Xattr Xattr_Value `protobuf:\"varint,36,opt,name=xattr,enum=openstorage.api.Xattr_Value\" json:\"xattr,omitempty\"` } Messages \u00b6 If at all possible, APIs must be supported forever once released. They will almost never be deprecated since at some point you may have many versions of the clients. So please be clear and careful on the API you create. If we need to change or update, you can always add values. Field Numbers \u00b6 If it is a new message, start with the field number of 1 . If it is an addition to a message, continue the field number sequence by one. If you are using oneof you may want to start with a large value for the field number so that they do not interfere with other values in the message: string s3_storage_class = 7; // Start at field number 200 to allow for expansion oneof credential_type { // Credentials for AWS/S3 SdkAwsCredentialRequest aws_credential = 200; // Credentials for Azure SdkAzureCredentialRequest azure_credential = 201; // Credentials for Google SdkGoogleCredentialRequest google_credential = 202; } Deprecation \u00b6 Here is the process if you would like to deprecate: According to proto3 Language Guide set the value in the message to deprecated and add a (deprecated) string to the comment as follows: // (deprecated) Field documentation here int32 field = 6 [deprecated = true]; Comment in the a changelog that the value is deprecated. Provide at least two releases before removing support for that value in the message. Make sure to document in the release notes of the product the deprecation. Once at least two releases have passed. Reserve the field number as shown in the proto3 Language Guide : message Foo { reserved 6; } It is essential that no values override the field number when updating or replacing. From Google's guide: Warning If you update a message type by entirely removing a field, or commenting it out, future users can reuse the field number when making their own updates to the type. This can cause severe issues if they later load old versions of the same .proto, including data corruption, privacy bugs, and so on. REST \u00b6 REST endpoints are autogenerated from the protofile by the grpc-gateway protoc compiler. All APIs should add the appropriate information to generate a REST endpoint for their service. Here is an example: rpc Inspect(RoleInspectRequest) returns (RoleInspectResponse){ option(google.api.http) = { get: \"/v1/roles/{name}\" }; } // Delete an existing role rpc Delete(RoleDeleteRequest) returns (RoleDeleteResponse){ option(google.api.http) = { delete: \"/v1/roles/{name}\" }; } // Update an existing role rpc Update(RoleUpdateRequest) returns (RoleUpdateResponse){ option(google.api.http) = { put: \"/v1/roles\" body: \"*\" }; } Here are the guidelines for REST commands: Endpoint must be prefixed as follows: /v1/<service name>/<rpc name if needed>/{any variables if needed} . Use the appropriate HTTP method. Here are some guidelines: For Create RPCs use the post http method For Inspect and List RPCs use the get http method For Update RPCs use the put http method For Delete RPCs use the delete http method Use get for immutable calls. Use put with body: \"*\" most calls that need to send a message to the SDK server. Please see grpc-gateway documentation for more information. Documentation \u00b6 All APIs, messages, and types should be documented if possible. The grpc-framework utilizes protoc-gen-doc to automatically generate documentation from your protocol buffers file. Documenting Messages Document each value of the message. Do not use Golang style. Do not repeat the name of the variable in Golang Camel Format in the comment to document it since the variable could be in other styles in other languages. For example: // Provides volume's exclusive bytes and its total usage. This cannot be // retrieved individually and is obtained as part node's usage for a given // node. message VolumeUsage { // id for the volume/snapshot string volume_id = 1; // name of the volume/snapshot string volume_name = 2; // uuid of the pool that this volume belongs to string pool_uuid = 3; // size in bytes exclusively used by the volume/snapshot uint64 exclusive_bytes = 4; // size in bytes by the volume/snapshot uint64 total_bytes = 5; // set to true if this volume is snapshot created by cloudbackups bool local_cloud_snapshot = 6; } Here is an example: \u00b6 Protocol buffers file: hello.proto Documentation in markdown format: hello.pb.md","title":"Style Guide"},{"location":"style-guide/#protocol-buffer-style-guide","text":"Please first read Google's Protocol Buffer Style Guide : Quote This document provides a style guide for .proto files.
