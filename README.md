# gRPC Framework
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/libopenstorage/grpc-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/libopenstorage/grpc-framework)

This framework makes it simple for developers to add gRPC and automated REST
interfaces for their applications.

Please see our [Documentation](https://libopenstorage.github.io/grpc-framework) for
more information.

* FYI, we are in the process of creating tutorials and adding more documentation
to the framework
